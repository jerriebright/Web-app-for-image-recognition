# WEB-APP-FOR-IMAGE-RECOGNITION

Object recognition is done using ResNet50 pre-trained network. We custom trained over the REsNet50 model for recognition of automobile components (Oil filter, Screw, etc.). Then deployed it using FLASK along with HTML, CSS and JS framework into web. <br>
The web app can also be deployed in a server using Gunicorn Heroku (for free). <br>
